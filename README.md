# Fract-ol

Fractol Project - Diving into the Fractal Universe ðŸŒ€


This project aims to render fractals, which have a mathematical structure and represent complex geometric patterns. It is capable of rendering different types of fractals such as Mandelbrot, Julia and Burning Ship fractals.

Project Content:

The project is written in C programming language and developed using the Graphics Library to provide a user-friendly graphical interface.
Mandelbrot, Julia and Burning Ship fractals can be explored interactively.
The user can zoom in, zoom out and change the color palette of the fractals.


How to Use:

Copy the project files to your computer.
Navigate to the project directory in the terminal or command client.
Compile and run the project files
