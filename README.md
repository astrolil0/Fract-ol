# Fract-ol

Fractol Project - Diving into the Fractal Universe 🌀

This project aims to render fractals, which have a mathematical structure and represent complex geometric patterns. It is capable of rendering different types of fractals such as Mandelbrot, Julia and Burning Ship fractals.


## Project Content:

The project is written in C programming language and developed using the Graphics Library to provide a user-friendly graphical interface.
Mandelbrot, Julia and Burning Ship fractals can be explored interactively.
The user can zoom in, zoom out and change the color palette of the fractals.




## How to Use

1. Copy the project files to your computer.
2. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal or command client.
3. Compile and run the project files
