# Fract-ol

Fractol Project - Diving into the Fractal Universe ðŸŒ€


This project aims to render fractals, which have a mathematical structure and represent complex geometric patterns. It is capable of rendering different types of fractals such as Mandelbrot, Julia and Burning Ship fractals.

Project Content:

The project is written in C programming language and developed using the Graphics Library to provide a user-friendly graphical interface.
Mandelbrot, Julia and Burning Ship fractals can be explored interactively.
The user can zoom in, zoom out and change the color palette of the fractals.
